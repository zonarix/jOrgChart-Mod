This is a very experimental "branch" of what Wes Nolte does at his repo.
We are considering to contribute advances and feature to his repo, once something
is worked out. In the meantime if you are interested in jOrgChart please contribute at
Wes Noltes repo and clone the original repo at https://github.com/wesnolte/jOrgChart
